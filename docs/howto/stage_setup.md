## How to set up a stage for an event

### Be block Seminar halls
Most seminar halls have the audio and video equipment in the right, only ground floor is an exception with it on the left.

- The **main power** switches are the very back, *inside* the brown enclosure with a door. Might need you to crouch to see them, but turn on all of them. The projector switches are usually small and white, the audio system ones are the 10 amp fat ones. While you don't have to turn all of them on, it's better to do so to preserve mental sanity.

- Turn on the **projector**. The projector usually turns on when you flip the switched inside the brown enclosure, just give it a while to power up. If it doesn't seem to to be turning on, hunt for the remote , *point* it at the projector and hit the power button. Two things might happen -
    - It *turns on*, and you're good to go.
    - It *doesn't turn on*.Hope its just dead batteries(almost always is) else you're screwed. Spare batteries can be found in the box with chalks and markers, else the dept has them. If batteries aren't the case you'll have to call the AV guy to fix it. If you're lucky, he'll be around and you can just ask him to fix it. If you're not, you'll have to call him and wait for him to show up. This can take anywhere from 5 minutes to 2 hours, so plan accordingly.
- HDMI cables are usually fine, but on occassion the ports are a little finnicky, so you might have to wiggle it around a bit to get it to work. If it still doesn't work, try the other port.

- The **audio system** is controlled by the mixer. It is usually powered on by default, but if it isn't, turn it on. The mixer is the big black box with a bunch of knobs and sliders. The power button is on the top right. Ignore most of the other knobs and sliders, just care about the master slider that controls volume.

- There are usually two **mics** in a seminar hall - a handheld one and a clip on. Both have small black colored receiver boxes inside the brown enclosure. Each of them correspond to one wireless mic. Do not touch them until absolutely necessary.
    - **Wireless handheld** 
        - The on/off switch is at the bottom. Check for battery level in the front display. If its okay, just **long press** the button at the bottom to turn it on. `Green = working, Orange = Not working`  If its low, you'll have to replace the batteries. [ Rare scenario : The mic is on, but the audio system isn't picking it up. This is usually because the mic is on the wrong channel, change its corresponding receiver to the correct channel.]

    - **Wireless clip-on**
        - Same as the previous one, only difference is that the mic is a lot more sensitive, so cna be used to stream audio from your laptop in a pinch. The batteries go in the front, just slide the front panel off.
- For audio forwarding from your laptop to the sound system, use the AUX cable lying around. Some floors don't have them, but most do. Just plug and play, better than HDMI forwarded audio
> When in doubt, ask the dept office, there's usually a guy who knows the ins and outs of this.

> For Air Conditioning (AC), go to the floor above the seminar hall's lower level and turn it on. The switch for the main unit is in one of the balconies past the respective washroom on that floor. ( barring ground floor's AC on ground,the rule holds.)

### Basement seminar hall
Usually used by Kannada Koota or DebSoc, avoid using it for a quiz at all costs. Very dark and gloomy with inadequate ventilation barring the two ACs in the back. Turn them on with the remote hanging from the ceiling if you must.
