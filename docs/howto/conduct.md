### Step 1: Scheduling the event
You’ll be asked to fill out a “Cultural Calendar of Events” at the start of every academic semester. This is a Google Sheet that is shared with all the clubs and departments. Once this calender is finalized adding an event is hard, so plan well. The filling is also FCFS, meaning that the earlier you fill it, the better your chances of getting the dates you want.


### Step 2 - Seeking approval
This is usually merely a formality for us since VK approves everything, but make sure you send this early (a week or two in advance) so that you can book the seminar hall and the auditorium for your event.
The mail should be of this format :

```
To: dean.studentaffairs@pes.edu
cc: rekha.ss@pes.edu, DSKDhruv@gmail.com, yashaswiap@gmail.com,shrithikreddy11122002@gmail.com, annasingh.pesu@gmail.com, teamfyi@pes.edu
Subject: Approval to Conduct an Event: QQC

```

### Step 3 - Booking the venue
Another new procedure introduced around 2022, we now rely on Qudify for booking anything bar MRD and Pesu-52. 

The procedure is as follows :

>Go to [THIS](http://qudify.co/employee-access-view) link.
- Username : qqc@pes.edu 
- Password : OTP system, you will get it in the qqc email

Note : Ground floor seminar hall is Seminar Hall 1 and so on in Qudify
The basement one is considered a classroom, so ask the CSE office if you need that.

After booking the hall on Qudify, Submit the following to the respective HOD under whom the seminar hall comes under:
- Qudify Hall Booking  Mail
- Event Proposal Mail
- VC Approval Mail
- Seminar Hall Letter(preferably attested by VK sir)


### Step 4 - App Notification
This is a new step that was introduced in 2020. You need to send a notification to the app team to get your event listed on the PESU app. The format is as follows :
```
To: support@pesuacademy.com, manjunath.mallapure@ayotta.com
cc: dean.studentaffairs@pes.edu, rekha.ss@pes.edu, teamfyi@pes.edu, shrithikreddy11122002@gmail.com, dskdhruv@gmail.com, yashaswiap@gmail.com
Subject: Requesting App Notification
Contents:
	A message about the event for the readers
	A Poster - 512x256 resolution 
```
>The email for app notification must be sent 3 days prior to the required date.
>Keep the dimensions in mind, any other dimensions will look out of place and odd.
>Make sure that when designing the poster itself you set the dimensions to 512x256 rather than compressing it later for it to get approved.
>The poster must be in **.png** format. 

### Step 5 - Photographer for Event
Pixels provides photographers for quizzes so you dont take some blurry and shaky photos in haste on your mobile phone. 

Send this email atleast 3 days in advance.

```
To: pixels@pes.edu
Subject: Request for photographer for event
Body:
To the person concerned,

QQC is conducting <Event_Name> on <Date> at <Time> in <Venue> with prior approval from the Vice Chancellor and the Dean of Student Affairs.
Hence we would like to request a photographer to take photos of the event for the club.
