### Step 1: Scheduling the event
You’ll be asked to fill out a “Cultural Calendar of Events” at the start of every academic semester. This is a Google Sheet that is shared with all the clubs and departments. Once this calender is finalized adding an event is hard, so plan well. The filling is also FCFS, meaning that the earlier you fill it, the better your chances of getting the dates you want.


### Step 2 - Seeking approval
This is usually merely a formality for us since VK approves everything, but make sure you send this early (a week or two in advance) so that you can book the seminar hall and the auditorium for your event.
The mail should be of this format :

```

Note : Ground floor seminar hall is hall 1, the basement one is considered a classroom, so ask the CSE office if you need that
