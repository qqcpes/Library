## How to represent the college in an external event

#### Approval

The following are the steps to be followed when representing the university at Inter-University fests and competitions:
- A request letter with details of the fest/ competition is to be drafted. The letter must include the likely expenses to be incurred with the complete details provided separately in a table.This needs the club faculty advisor's signature - so in our case VK's himself. Don't bother with your individual faculty advisor.

- The invitation/ brochure of the fest (could be a printout from the website) must be attached.
- A list of the students participating with details: Name, SRN, Department, Semester, Campus, Event/Competition
- Student Declaration forms with a clear ‘no objection’ from the parents.
> All of the above must be submitted to the Dean, Student Affairs - Dr. V Krishna - dean.studentaffairs@pes.edu 

#### Reimbursement

Take a print-out of the following:
- Proposal Mail
- VC’s Approval Mail
- Report on the event with sample photos
- Details of expenses with necessary bills

>Make sure to sign all of the documents yourself and also get VK’s signature on them.

Get these attested by VK and submit them to the Accounts Department. 
>Note : In most cases, VK himself will send it to accounts, you just have to submit it at the office
