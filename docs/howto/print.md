## How to print stuff

**Step 1 - Get the design done right**

Make sure it isn't too complicated and is in the right format. There are times when you think the document is in A4 format, but it isnt. So make sure you check it properly.
Complex designs, backgrounds, gradients, etc. are not recommended. They do not transalte well to print.
> Always prefer using svg files for images They are scalable and can be used for any size. If unavoidable prefer png over jpeg (jpeg is too lossy). If you are using png or jpg, make sure the resolution is high enough for the size you are printing it in.
> `svg >> png >> jpg`

**Step 2 - Timeframe**

If you want a design go from the club, you need to give them a minimum of 2 days to get it done. If you want it done from an external source, you need to give them a minimum of 3-4 days. This is because they have other work to do as well. So make sure you plan ahead. (This method is free)

Once the design is ready send a mail to VK sir along with the attached image. Make sure PES logo is there on the poster.
NOTE - DO NOT SEND TO PRINTING PRESS. VK SIR WILL FORWARD THE MAIL HIMSELF.

The mail should be of this format :

```
To: dean.studentaffairs@pes.edu
cc: DSKDhruv@gmail.com, yashaswiap@gmail.com,shrithikreddy11122002@gmail.com
Subject: Request for poster for Event 
Body:
Respected Sir,
PFA the poster for <Event> on <Date>. We request for <Number> posters in A3 size.

Thanking you,
Team QQC
```
Once you have sent the mail, wait for the printing press to reply that the posters have been printed. Once they do, go and collect it(This takes 1-2 days so plan in advance with your design team)

>If you dont know where the printing press is... :|
> 
>Go to the basement of Management Block(Some people call it Tech Park).
> 
>Head towards the left side of the lift and you should see a room stacked with bundles of paper. You have now arrived at your destination. :)



If you want it done from an external source, you can contact [this guy]() and he should get it done in 3-4 days.

> If you want posters super quick (by lunch break by example), you'll just have to get it printed yourself. 
The first shop to your right in Gully charges &#8377;20 for a glossy A4 print and &#8377;40 for a glossy A3 print (both of impressive quality).
