>_Dear future presidents,_
>
>_We realized that there is a lot of knowledge that is not being passed down from one generation of QQC to the next so this is an attempt to fix that._
_This is your knowledge base for all things QQC and hopefully remains an able guide for the future. This is a living document that will be updated as the club lives on and future members learn more about the workings._
_This is also a place to document the history of the club and the people who have been a part of it._
>
>_While we can't promise to have covered everything in this document, we hope it remains an able guide to all the leaders of the club in the years to come._
